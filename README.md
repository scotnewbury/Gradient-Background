# Gradient-Background

This project is based on the Gradient Background exercise in the Zero to Mastery course on Udemy.com.

I added a button to allow the visitor to randomly generate a background gradient as well as have the page load a random gradient when it loads.

You can see a live version of it at: https://codepen.io/scotnewbury/pen/wNGXNz
